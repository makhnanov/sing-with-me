N: Am I throwing you off?
T: Nope
N: Didn't think so
T: How you doin' young lady
That feelin' that you givin' really drives me crazy
You don't have a play about the joke
I was at a loss of words first time that we spoke
N: You're looking for a girl that'll treat you right
You lookin' for her in the day time with a light
T: You might be the type if I play my cards right
I'll find out by the end of the night
N: You expect me to just let you hit it,
But will you still respect me if you get it?
T: All I can do is try, gimme one chance
What's the problem I don't see no ring on your hand
I be the first to admit it, I'm curious about you
You seem so innocent
N: You wanna get in my world, get lost in it
Boy I'm tired of running, lets walk for a minute
T: Promiscuous girl
Wherever you are
I'm all alone
And it's you that I want
N: Promiscuous boy
You already know
That I'm all yours
What you waiting for?
T: Promiscuous girl
You're teasing me
You know what I want
And I got what you need
N: Promiscuous boy
Let's get to the point
Cause we're on a roll
You ready?
N: Roses are red
Some diamonds are blue
Chivalry is dead
But you're still kinda cute
T: Hey! I can't keep my mind off of you
Where you at? Do you mind if I come through?
N: I'm out of this world come with me to my planet
Get you on my level do you think that you can handle it?
T: They call me Thomas
Last name Crown
Recognize game
I'm a lay mine down
N: I'm a big girl I can handle myself
But if I get lonely I'ma need your help
Pay attention to me I don't talk for my health
T: I want you on my team
N: So does everybody else.
T: Baby we can keep it on the low
Let your guard down ain't nobody gotta know
If you wanna girl I know a place we can go
N: What kind of girl do you take me for?
T: Promiscuous girl
Wherever you are
I'm all alone
And it's you that I want
N: Promiscuous boy
You already know
That I'm all yours
What you waiting for?
T: Promiscuous girl
You're teasing me
You know what I want
And I got what you need
N: Promiscuous boy
Let's get to the point
Cause we're on a roll
You ready?
T: Don't be mad, don't get mean
N: Don't get mad, don't be mean
T: Don't be mad, don't get mean
N: Don't get mad, don't be mean
T: Wait! I don't mean no harm
I can see you with my t-shirt on
N: I can see you with nothing on
Feeling all me before you bring that on
T: Bring that on?
N: You know what I mean
T: Girl, I'm a freak you shouldn't say those things
N: I'm only trying to get inside your brain
To see if you can work me the way you say
T: It's okay, it's alright
I got something that you gon' like
N: Is it the truth or are you talking trash
Is your game M.V.P. like Steve Nash
T: Promiscuous Girl
Wherever you are
I'm all alone
And its you that I want
N: Promiscuous Boy
I'm calling your name
But you're driving me crazy
The way you're making me wait
T: Promiscuous Girl
You're teasing me
You know what I want
And I got what you need
N: Promiscuous Boy
We're one 'n the same
So we don't gotta play games no more
