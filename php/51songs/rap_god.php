    [8], // But I'm only going to get this one chance
    [11], // Something's wrong, I can feel it
    [13], // Just a feeling I've got,
    [17], // Like something's about to happen, but I don't know what
    [21], // If that means, what I think it means, we're in trouble, big trouble,
    [24], // And if he is as bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances
    [26], // You were just what the doctor ordered
    [29], // I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
    [32], // All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
    [35], // Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slapbox, slapbox?
    [38], // They said I rap like a robot, so call me Rapbot
    [40], // But for me to rap like a computer must be in my genes
    [42], // I got a laptop in my back pocket
    [43], // My pen'll go off when I half-cock it
    [45], // Got a fat knot from that rap profit
    [46], // Made a living and a killing off it
    [48], // Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
    [50], // With Monica Lewinsky feeling on his nut-sack
    [51], // I'm an MC still as honest
    [52], // But as rude and as indecent as all hell
    [54], // Syllables, killaholic (Kill 'em all with)
    [56], // This slickety, gibbedy, hibbedy hip-hop
    [58], // You don't really wanna get into a pissing match with this rappidy rap
    [59], // Packing a Mac in the back of the Ac,
    [1], // Backpack rap crap, yep, yep, yackity-yak
    [2], // Now at the exact same time
    [4], // I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicing that
    [6], // I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table
    [8], // Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
    [9], // Only realized it was ironic
    [11], // I was signed to Aftermath after the fact
    [12], // How could I not blow?
    [14], // All I do is drop F-bombs, feel my wrath of attack
    [16], // Rappers are having a rough time period, here's a maxipad
    [18], // It's actually disastrously bad for the wack
    [21], // While I'm masterfully constructing this masterpiece as
    [24], // I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
    [27], // All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
    [30], // Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slapbox, slapbox?
    [33], // Let me show you maintaining this shit ain't that hard, that hard
    [37], // Everybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like I have got
    [39], // Well, to be truthful the blueprint's simply rage and youthful exuberance
    [41], // Everybody loves to root for a nuisance
    [43], // Hit the earth like an asteroid, did nothing but shoot for the moon since
    [46], // MC's get taken to school with this music
    [48], // Cause I use it as a vehicle to bust a rhyme
    [49], // Now I lead a new school full of students
    [52], // Me? I'm a product of Rakim, Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac N-
    [56], // -W.A, Cube, Hey Doc, Ren, Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim
    [59], // Inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up and be in a position
    [3], // To meet Run DMC, induct them, into the motherfuckin' Rock n' Roll Hall of Fame
    [5], // Even though I walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames
    [8], // Only Hall of Fame I be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
    [9], // On the wall of shame
    [13], // You fags think it's all a game 'til I walk a flock of flames
    [16], // Off a plank, and tell me what in the fuck are you thinking?
    [17], // Little gay looking boy
    [19], // So gay I can barely say it with a straight face looking boy (haha!)
    [20], // You witnessing a massacre
    [22], // Like you watching a church gathering take place looking boy
    [25], // Oy vey, that boy's gay, that's all they say looking boy
    [27], // You get a thumbs up, pat on the back
    [29], // And a way to go from your label everyday looking boy
    [30], // Hey, looking boy, what you say looking boy?
    [32], // I get a "hell yeah" from Dre looking boy
    [33], // I'mma work for everything I have
    [35], // Never ask nobody for shit, get outta my face looking boy
    [37], // Basically boy you're never gonna be capable
    [39], // To keeping up with the same pace looking boy
    [41], // I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
    [45], // All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
    [48], // The way I'm racing around the track, call me Nascar, Nascar
    [50], // Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God
    [54], // Kneel before General Zod this planet's Krypton, no Asgard, Asgard
    [58], // So you be Thor and I'll be Odin, you rodent, I'm omnipotent
    [1], // Let off then I'm reloading immediately with these bombs I'm totin'
    [3], // And I should not be woken
    [6], // I'm the walking dead, but I'm just a talking head, a zombie floating
    [8], // But I got your mom deep throating
    [11], // I'm out my ramen noodle, we have nothing in common, poodle
    [14], // I'm a doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil
    [17], // It's me, my honesty's brutal
    [20], // But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though
    [21], // For good at least once in a while
    [22], // So I wanna make sure somewhere
    [24], // In this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle
    [26], // Enough rhymes to maybe try to help
    [27], // Get some people through tough times
    [30], // But I gotta keep a few punchlines just in case cause even you unsigned
    [32], // Rappers are hungry looking at me like it's lunchtime
    [34], // I know there was a time where once I
    [35], // Was king of the underground,
    [37], // But I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind
    [40], // So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine
    [41], // Appeal with the skin color of mine
    [44], // You get too big and here they come trying to censor you
    [45], // Like that one line I said
    [47], // On "I'm Back" from the Mathers LP1
    [50], // Where I tried to say I take seven kids from Columbine
    [53], // Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a nine
    [57], // See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was
    [59], // But I've morphed into an immortal coming through the portal
    [1], // You're stuck in a timewarp from 2004 though
    [3], // And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for
    [6], // You're pointless as Rapunzel with fucking cornrows
    [8], // You're like normal, fuck being normal
    [10], // And I just bought a new Raygun from the future
    [12], // To just come and shoot ya like when Fabolous made Ray J mad
    [14], // Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather's pad
    [16], // Singin' to a man while they played piano
    [19], // Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel
    [22], // So Ray J went straight to the radio station the very next day
    [23], // ''Hey, Fab, I'mma kill you''
    [25], // Lyrics coming at you at supersonic speed, (JJ Fad)
    [27], // Uh, sama lamaa duma lamaa you assuming I'm a human
    [29], // What I gotta do to get it through to you I'm superhuman
    [30], // Innovative and I'm made of rubber
    [32], // So that anything you say is ricocheting off of me and it'll glue to you
    [33], // I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating
    [35], // How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating
    [37], // Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting
    [38], // For the day that they can say I fell off, they'd be celebrating
    [40], // Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated
    [42], // I make elevating music, you make elevator music
    [43], // Oh, he's too mainstream
    [45], // Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it
    [48], // It's not hip hop, it's pop, cause I found a hella way to fuse it
    [50], // With rock, shock rap with Doc
    [51], // Throw on Lose Yourself and make 'em lose it
    [53], // I don't know how to make songs like that
    [54], // I don't know what words to use
    [56], // Let me know when it occurs to you
    [58], // While I'm ripping any one of these verses, that versus you
    [59], // It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you
    [1], // How many verses I gotta murder to prove
    [3], // That if you were half as nice at songs,
    [4], // You can sacrifice virgins to (ughhh)
    [7], // School flunkie, pill junky
    [9], // But look at the accolades the skills brung me
    [11], // Full of myself, but still hungry
    [14], // I bully myself cause I make me do what I put my mind to
    [16], // And I'm a million leagues above you,
    [18], // Ill when I speak in tongues
    [19], // But it's still tongue in cheek, fuck you
    [21], // I'm drunk so Satan take the fucking wheel,
    [23], // I'm asleep in the front seat
    [26], // Bumping Heavy D and the Boys, still chunky, but funky
    [29], // But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling
    [32], // Angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me
    [35], // They're asking me to eliminate some of the women hate
    [37], // But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred I had
    [39], // Then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situation
    [41], // And understand the discrimination
    [44], // But fuck it, life's handing you lemons, make lemonade then
    [47], // But if I can't batter the women how the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?
    [49], // Don't mistake it for Satan
    [51], // It's a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas
    [53], // And take a vacation to trip abroad
    [56], // And make her fall on her face and don't be a retard
    [1], // Be a king? Think not — why be a king when you can be a God?
